# Stock-Prediciton-Using-LSTM-and-LMU
I have predicted the reliance stock prices of the next 4 trading days using the past closings. I have used LSTM and LMU to predict the prices. 
I am still left to complete the LMU(Legendre Memory Unit) as I have to build its algorithm from ground up. 
You can see in the picture below that how precisely my LSTM follows the price trend. I am anticipating that LMU would be better than this.
